# Angband3D — Status & Next Steps Roadmap

## Current System State (Post Low-Hanging Fruit & Viewmodel Hand Enhancements)

1. **Engine Bridge**:
   - Upstream Angband 4.2.6 fork on branch `bridge` with `main-bridge.c`.
   - Complete player telemetry: HP, SP, AC, Max/Exp/Next Exp, Gold, Stats (STR/INT/WIS/DEX/CON with reductions), active statuses array, targeting monster tracker, depth/feelings, physical height (`ht`) and weight (`wt`), equipped light source, weapons (`weapon_item`), bows (`bow_item`), shields (`shield_item`), cause of death (`died_from`), and fully identified `equipment`, `inventory`, and `quiver` object arrays on death.
   - 11/11 bridge smoke tests passing (`python tools/smoke_test.py`).
   - Patch file `engine-patch/0001-bridge-frontend.patch` fully synchronized.

2. **Godot 4.7.2 C# Client**:
   - **Full-Featured Death Experience & Post-Mortem Disclosure (`Overlay.cs`, `Main.cs`)**:
     - Atmospheric death screen with funeral toll audio bells (`PlayerDeath` SFX).
     - Full item & runes disclosure across Equipment, Backpack Inventory, Quiver Missiles, and Ability Scores.
     - One-click / one-key quick actions: `[R]` Reload last saved game, `[N]` Re-roll new character, `[M / Esc]` Return to main menu.
   - **First-Person Viewmodel & Hands (`ViewModel.cs`)**:
     - Tapered forearm sleeves with class-tailored fabric shaders.
     - Modeled wrist cuffs / metal bracers.
     - Articulated palm, opposable thumb, and 4 sculpted fingers with natural grip wraps around wielded weapon and torch handles.
     - Character height & race scale adaptation ($0.70\text{m} - 2.10\text{m}$ eye heights).
     - Reactive camera bob, weapon sway, attack slash/thrust animations, spellcast surges, and hit trauma recoil.
   - **Item & Monster Model Resolution**:
     - Full item matching for swords, daggers, 2H axes, 1H axes, staves, bows, crossbows, shields, books, wands, and torches.
     - Bare hands / martial fists when unarmed.
     - Animated 3D pickups with continuous hover, slow rotation, and emissive color accents.
   - **Audio & Juice Feedback**:
     - Positional sound effects (`AudioManager.cs`) for footsteps, melee impacts, spell zaps, door creaks, and stairs.
     - Floating damage numbers & crits (`Label3D` billboarding), hit sparks, and camera screen-shake.
   - **Dungeon Aesthetics & Clutter**:
     - Deterministic wall sconces with point lights in corridors (`DungeonClutterResolver.cs`).
     - Procedural props and furniture in rooms.
   - **Dark Unmapped Area Sealing & Dynamic Emission Gating (`DungeonWorld.cs`)**:
     - Unmapped rock boundary sealing: tiles with `FEAT_NONE` bordering explored walkable/portal space automatically render as dark solid stone boundary walls, eliminating see-through voids into the unmapped world.
     - Dynamic per-instance emission shader for lava and magma: modulates emission by instance alpha (`COLOR.a`), ensuring full incandescent molten glow in direct line-of-sight while extinguishing emission in player memory or dark areas.
     - Enclosed subterranean lava pools with dungeon ceilings, avoiding black void cutouts.
   - **Option A Cloud Architecture & Dual-Engine Relay (`server/`, `WebSocketBridgeClient.cs`, `Main.cs`)**:
      - Headless Linux multi-stage Docker container (`server/Dockerfile`, `server/docker-compose.yml`) hosting Angband 4.2.6 C engine with Bridge protocol.
      - High-performance WebSocket daemon (`server/src/server.js`) with isolated child process management per session, REST API for save file management (`/api/saves`), and static file delivery.
      - Dual-engine client architecture: unified `IGameEngineBridge` supporting runtime toggling between `Local Engine` (process stdio) and `Cloud Realm` (WebSockets) with roundtrip ping telemetry on the HUD.
      - **Web 3D Graphics & Controls Overhaul (`dungeon3d.js`, `input.js`)**:
         - 1:1 mathematical parity with desktop Godot client for movement and camera turning: fixed inverted Arrow Keys and Numpad mappings.
         - Authentic 2K PBR texture maps (`T_Brick`, `T_UnevenBrick`, `T_RockTrim`, `T_WoodTrim`, `T_Plaster`) with normal maps, roughness maps, anisotropic filtering, and sRGB encoding.
         - ACESFilmic tone mapping, warm multi-wave torchlight flicker, secondary bounce fill, and atmospheric distance fog.
         - 3D viewmodel weapon (`Sword.obj` via `OBJLoader`) and illuminated torch with inner/outer flame cones.
         - High-DPI 512x512 Runic Monster Tokens with dynamic overhead health bars, glowing glyphs, and engraved name banners.
         - Distinct 3D items (Gold stacks, Potions, Scrolls, Weapons, Rings) with floating bob and rotation.
         - Deployed and serving on Google Cloud Run (`https://angband3d-cloud-564958309282.us-central1.run.app`).
   - **Universal Save Game Portability & Permadeath Snapshots (`Main.cs`, `Overlay.cs`)**:
      - In-game `Save Game Manager` menu: archive saves to timestamped backups (`lib/save/backups/`), export `.sav` files directly to user Downloads, and restore backups with `SaveVNLA` binary validation.
      - Bi-directional Cloud Sync: Upload local characters to cloud server and synchronize cloud characters down to local disk.
      - In-game Standalone Package Download: Menu action to download the offline game bundle (`.zip`) directly from within the game.
   - **Graphics & Spatial Occlusion Culling (`DungeonWorld.cs`)**:
      - Radial horizon culling ($R \le 28$ tiles) eliminating instance buffer updates outside the maximum visible fog horizon.
      - Fast 8-neighbor interior solid rock culling: detects completely enclosed stone blocks buried within the mountain bedrock and skips GPU instance transforms, reducing MultiMesh instance counts by up to 70% with zero visual fidelity loss.

## Active Execution Focus & High-Fidelity Roadmap (Daggerfall / Skyrim Aesthetic Track)

The project has achieved the **Tier 4 Visual & Environmental Overhaul**: delivering immersive dungeon atmosphere, depth-based biome shifts, dynamic torch flame VFX, rich PBR materials, and 2.5D normal-mapped monster rendering, while preserving 100% of viewmodel, tracking, and bridge architecture.

### Priority 1: Depth-Based Biomes & Atmospheric Lighting (COMPLETED)
- **Scope**: `client/scripts/DungeonWorld.cs`
- **Accomplishments**:

  - 6 distinct subterranean depth zones: Town & Overworld (0), Upper Crypts (1-15), Overgrown Catacombs (16-35), Crystal Caverns (36-60), Magma Underworld (61-85), and Abyssal Throne (86-100+).
  - Dynamic `WorldEnvironment` properties (`FogDensity`, `FogLightColor`, `AmbientLightColor`, `AmbientLightEnergy`, `TonemapExposure`).
  - Active atmospheric particulate emitter (`CpuParticles3D`) dynamically configured per biome for dust motes, luminous spores, crystal shimmers, and rising volcanic embers.

### Priority 2: High-Fidelity PBR Materials & Normal/Roughness Mapping (COMPLETED)
- **Scope**: `client/scripts/DungeonWorld.cs`
- **Accomplishments**:
